## ✋ Hand Gesture Recognition with AI-Generated Feedback

This project is an innovative blend of computer vision, AI, and real-time interactivity, designed to recognize hand gestures and generate context-aware feedback using Google’s Gemini model. The application is built using OpenCV, cvzone, Streamlit, and Google Generative AI, providing a hands-on experience with AI-powered interaction.

## 🚀 Features
1. Real-Time Hand Gesture Recognition: Detects hand gestures using the webcam and interprets them with advanced hand tracking.
2. AI-Generated Content: Leverages the Gemini model to generate contextual feedback based on the recognized gestures.
3. Interactive Drawing Board: Draw using your fingers in the air, and see your artwork come to life on the screen.
4. Streamlit Integration: A user-friendly interface to interact with the application, making it accessible directly through your browser.

## 💡 How It Works
1. Hand Gesture Recognition: Uses cvzone and OpenCV to detect hand landmarks and identify specific gestures.
2. AI Content Generation: Once a particular gesture is recognized, the corresponding canvas drawing is processed and sent to the Gemini model for content generation.
3. Dynamic Output: The generated content is displayed in real-time on the Streamlit app interface.

## 📚 Technologies Used
1. Python
2. Mediapipe & cvzone
3. Streamlit
4. Google Generative AI (Gemini Model)
5. PIL (Python Imaging Library)
6. Numpy
